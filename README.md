# FsDepend
Functional Dependency Injection for FSharp

This module provides a novel approach to dependency injection in F#.

Among its features:
- Simple and explicit injection definitions with defaults
- Fast: functions are fully resolved and ready to be used
- Selective, multilevel, partial and localized code injection
- Capacity to print out injectable entries
- A natural way to coding progresion with reduced refactoring
